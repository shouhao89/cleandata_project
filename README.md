# Getting and Cleaning Data Course Project

The R script in this repo, `run_analysis.R` calculates means per activity and subject, for the mean and Standard deviation of the Human Activity Recognition Using Smartphones Dataset Version 1.0 [1]. This dataset can be [downloaded](https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fprojectfiles%2FUCI%20HAR%20Dataset.zip) and extracted directly into the data directory.


The script outputs the file: `./tidy_data.txt`
